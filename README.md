# Overview

We simply made a trivia game web application. This application fetches questions from an API, lets users sign up and create accounts, play the game, and view a profile page. We made this to learn django and become more familiar with web application devlopment.

# Development Environment
We used VScode to develop this software
We used python and django to develop this software, with a little bit of HTML, CSS, annd Javascript for the simple front end.
